  <p>Mindspace is a place to slow down, reflect, and explore ideas in progress. 
Here, I share thoughts, lessons, and creative sparks that shape both my work 
and personal journey. It’s meant to feel like a conversation — open, thoughtful, 
and evolving — where you’re always welcome to step in and take something away.</p>
